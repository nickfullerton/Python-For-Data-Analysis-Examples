# Python-For-Data-Analysis-Examples

This repository contains some of the examples in the book Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney  

The examples include using real life data, asking questions about the data, cleaning the data, and then answering the questions through visualization.


## Description  


### Built With  

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)


### USA.gov Data from Bitly

In this mini project, we load in a .txt file of users who shortened their links using bitly with the links ending in .gov or .mil.  
We then clean the data and visualize the amount of users from different time zones who shortened their link.
Using the same data from the previous visualization, we then seperate each time zone from windows/non windows users.


### US Baby Names

In this mini project, we visulaize the proportion of babies given a particular name over time.  
We then determine the most popular names in each year or the names whose popularity has advanced or declined the most.  
Then we analyze trends in names: vowels, consonants, length, overall diversity, changes in spelling, first and last letters. 


### USDA Food Database

In this mini project, we load in a json file containing records of food and thier nutrition.  
We then clean the data to visualize the median values by food group and nutrient type.  


### 2012 Federal Election Commission Database

In this mini project, we load in a .csv file from the 2012 Federal Election, containing infomation about political contributions to certain campaigns.  
We then clean the data and visualize the amount contributed by a certain occupation to either the democrat or republican party.  
We then visualize the percentage of total donations of certain sizes to either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney.
